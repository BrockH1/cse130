# 1. Name:
#      Brock Hoskins
# 2. Assignment Name:
#      Lab 01: Guessing Game
# 3. Assignment Description:
#      This program generates a random number between 1 and a given range from the user and the user guesses what the random number is.
# 4. What was the hardest part? Be as specific as possible.
#      The only difficulty I had was converting the user's input into an integer. I realized that I can't type int(input), but instead int(input()).
# 5. How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
#      It probably took a little under an hour to complete the assignment.
